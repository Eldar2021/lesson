/*
Booleans
In the following lesson, we will go over the boolean data type.

True & False#
Dartâ€™s bool type represents boolean values. Only two objects have type bool, 
the boolean literals true and false.

In the code snippet below, we are declaring a variable b1 of type bool and 
assigning it an initial value of true.
*/

main() {
  bool b1 = true;
  print(b1);
}
